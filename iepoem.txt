These are the things that I identify with
These paint me different from my kin and kith
Do I get to choose who I am or do I have to be
Subconsciously I am just what all else want to see

I am educated, trained and experienced
but never to play a field so unbalanced
my passions take the backseat
as I take on the wheels
to do the same thing on repeat,
daily, without any feels

I belong to no place and nothing belongs to me
And yet I am that character that you long to see
I could officially be nobody or be everybody
can’t expect more from a system so shoddy

Was I ever born or will I ever die
If I choose not their way to identify
I got a license and got myself a passport
but they want to force their way despite the court

Privileged I thought was my place since my birth
A lie that quickly laughed at my pride in mirth
As much as I strived to earn all that I merited
I still got held back by the identity that I inherited

I am the face that have no option but to face
the wrath about who I am, furious with no face
They are the legion because they just conform
expect us to fall in line or get caught in their storm

These are not the things that I identify with
But they are the rules that I comply with
Rules that are binding and must be voluntarily followed
I had pride in my identity but now I swallowed.
