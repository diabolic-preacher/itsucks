working through the weekend. 
not something that i would want to do on a regular basis and hopefully would not be required to do so as well. but here i am having opened my work laptop on 2 days out of a 3 day weekend. the only difference is that, i have no intention whatsoever to make great plans for outing or doing something really weekendy like, so it does not help to wait at home for the weekend to pass while i clearly recall the lax/procrastination that i had more of than productivity. in my defence, (as if i need to justify to myself, but my honor...) the products i test are shit. i chase erratic behavior across several similar devices, which basically means that i found an error in device A, then in B, then in C, but then not in A, but in B but not in C. not only developers but even devices are having fun at my lack of domain knowledge and a bloody closed environment as a QA (no not my locked apartment). Tests take so much time.

on the other hand, i didn’t push myself to put in full work day hours because my intention were to get the ball rolling towards reaching my target sooner. I don’t even think I put in any significant time on Saturday, but on Sunnday, I did check off a few items that I could understand the steps of. Sooner I finish, hopefully sooner I can dedicate my time and efforts towards the work I had taken an interest in the job for.
